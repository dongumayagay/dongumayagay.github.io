                    <h3>Space shooter game</h3>
                    <p>using pygame a python 2d library, it is like space impact.
                        i learned OOP because you need to track every bullets' x and y coordinate so you need to make a class of bullets and enemies and track them.
                        also you need to apply physics and collison detections
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        a school project to use Java with conjuction to MySQL. i use it to make make a social media like app. you can make account and make a post to a bulletin board. you can follow another user and the hard part of these program is a conversation thread. a inbox and a sentbox is easy to implement but thread is better even though it is harder.

                I love Science, Technology and Engineering. I want to be like Ironman who uses Technolgy for good or maybe realistically like Elon Musk, who also starts with just programming making Paypal and now making Electric car for environment for future, Spaceship for Humanity's exploration. Neuralink so he can help disabled people and maybe in future augment humans.</p>
            <br>
            <p>That's my inspiration for studying computers, using technolgy for good.</p>
